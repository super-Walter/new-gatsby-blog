### I’m not as good as people online
This one is very popular. People think that YouTubers or any other programmer online that makes coding tutorials just knows everything and never fails or uses Google. That’s wrong.
### The Truth
What you don’t know about those tutorials is that the creator of that tutorial actually failed a lot of times. And spent hours searching for answers.
After he finishes building the product, he starts recording. And it just goes perfect. He never fails while recording those tutorials.
### And why?
Because he already knows how to build it, and what won’t work. Every time he fails or finishes building a new project, he gets even more experienced.
So, what should I do?
First of all, you should stop thinking that you are bad.
Then, you should open your PC, and start a new project. It can be a blog, a chat app or a todo app. Build whatever you want, it doesn’t matter what you build, only how you build it matters.
### What do you mean by “how”?
Well, if you start a new project, and then open YouTube and type “How to build xxx”, it won't help you. Because remember, the best way to learn new stuff is trial-and-error.
If you really want to learn something, you should do it on your own by just reading documentation, searching for answers, and so on.
